## About This Repository
This repository contains my practical exercises for CP1404. It includes projects and exercises completed during the course, demonstrating programming concepts, clean code practices, and problem-solving skills.  

### About Me
My name is Joshua, I am currently studying Electrical Engineering at JCU.  

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Meaningful Names: Using descriptive variable, function, and class names makes code more readable and understandable.  
- Modular Design: Breaking code into functions and classes improves maintainability and reusability.  
- Commenting and Documentation: Proper docstrings and comments help explain the purpose of code.
