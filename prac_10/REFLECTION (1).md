# CP1404 Practical Reflection



## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

    Depending on the week and the amount of effort put into learning the content, i would say that my estimations for 
    the most part were pretty accurate or way off, usually from underestimating the amount of effort the practical was
    going to take.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

    The accuracy did not improve a great deal, there were weeks that i forgot to implement the estimated time and the 
    actual time it took to complete

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

    Not to underestimate the amount of work that it actually took to do so many practicals and all the file required 
    for submission at the end of the week

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

    The very few comments i recivied from other people helped me with basic imperitive mood and naming convetions

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

    I learned that everyone has a very different style of how they write code and how they interact with it

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

    Although the amount of practical deliverables was a bit much they did help impliment what we were taught, however 
    due to the amount of effort required, often hindered the ability to focus on other subjects, i personally would
    decrease the amount of deliverables as one specific practical deliverable was longer than the first assignment worth
    a sufficient amount less.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
    
    Attempted them all without looking at the solutions provided first which helped me learn the content.
